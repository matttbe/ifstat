InterFace STATistics

=========================================

To do:
- add support for other systems; contributions appreciated :)
- rate adaptative unit display
- maybe a generic lib that could be used by other similar apps
  (say all dockapps for instance) with a snmp-like interface ?
- indexed polling for snmp/ifmib
