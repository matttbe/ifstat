InterFace STATistics

=========================================

* Introduction

Ifstat is a little tool to report interface activity like vmstat/iostat do.
Since gathering these statistics is highly system dependant, only a
few operating systems are supported right now:

   Linux with /proc/net/dev interface (Linux >= 2.2.x)
   Solaris with kstat(3K) interface (Solaris >= 2.6.x)
   FreeBSD with ifmib(4) interface (FreeBSD > 2.2)
   BSDs with kvm(3) interface (tested on FreeBSD & OpenBSD)

Others might be easy to add, or might simply work out-of-the-box if
some compatibility layer is there. As usual your mileage may vary.

In addition, ifstat can poll remote hosts through SNMP if you have
the ucd-snmp library. It will also be used for localhost if no other
known method works (You need to have snmpd running for this though).
 
* Compilation

To compile, just un the configure script as follows:

   ./configure

You might need to pass several options to the configure script. Refer
to the INSTALL file for generic configure instructions. This package
accepts the following extra-options:

   --enable-debug     This turns debugging on in the library.
   --enable-optim     This turns on some gcc optimization flags.
   --with-snmp=prefix Specify where the snmp library is installed
   --without-snmp     This turns off support for SNMP.

Then, run the make command:

   make

and finally, to install it run:

   make install

* Usage

Simply run ifstat and see stats rolling ;)
