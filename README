InterFace STATistics

=========================================

* Introduction

Ifstat is a little tool to report interface activity like vmstat/iostat do.
Since gathering these statistics is highly system dependant, only a
few operating systems are supported right now:

   Linux with /proc/net/dev interface (Linux >= 2.2.x)
   Solaris with kstat(3K) interface (Solaris >= 2.6.x)
   FreeBSD with ifmib(4) interface (FreeBSD > 2.2)
   BSDs with kvm(3) interface (tested on FreeBSD & OpenBSD)

Others might be easy to add, or might simply work out-of-the-box if
some compatibility layer is there. As usual your mileage may vary.

In addition, ifstat can poll remote hosts through SNMP if you have
the ucd-snmp library. It will also be used for localhost if no other
known method works (You need to have snmpd running for this though).
 
* Compilation

To compile, just un the configure script as follows:

   ./configure

You might need to pass several options to the configure script. Refer
to the INSTALL file for generic configure instructions. This package
accepts the following extra-options:

   --enable-debug     This turns debugging on in the library.
   --enable-optim     This turns on some gcc optimization flags.

By default, all the statistics gathering drivers are checked for 
availibility until a working one is found, but several can be
included. If you wish to force inclusion of an alternate driver 
(if available) or disable one, you can use one of the following options:

   --with-proc        Force support of /proc if available.
   --without-proc     Do not includen support for /proc.
   --with-kstat       Force support of kstat if available.
   --without-kstat    Do not includen support for kstat.
   --with-ifmib       Force support of ifmib if available.
   --without-ifmib    Do not include support for ifmib.
   --with-kvm         Force support for kvm if available.
   --without-kvm      Do not include support for kvm.
   --with-snmp=prefix Specify where the snmp library is installed
   --without-snmp     Do not include support for SNMP.
   --with-libcrypto   Force use of libcrypto with UCD-SNMP. This is needed
                      on at least OpenBSD, since the snmp library links
                      but doesn't run without it.

Then, run the make command:

   make

and finally, to install it run:

   make install

* Usage

Simply run ifstat and see stats rolling ;)
