=head1 NAME

ifstat - Report InterFace STATistics

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ifstat> [B<-i> if0,if1,...] [B<-s> [comm@][#]host] [B<-h>] [B<-n>] [B<-v>] [delay [count]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ifstat is a little tool to report interface activity in KBps, just like iostat/vmstat do for other system statistics.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<ifstat> accepts the following options:

=over 4

=item B<-i>

Specifies the list of interfaces to monitor, separated by commas (if an interface name has a comma, it can be escaped with '\'). By default B<ifstat> monitors all interfaces that are up.

=item B<-s>

Specifies a host to poll through SNMP to get stats. Default community is public, but can be changed by prepending "comm@" to the hostname. If host starts by a #, interface names are generated from their index as `ifNN' (this is a workaround for some equipments that give all interfaces the same description).

=item B<-h>

Displays a short help message.

=item B<-n>

Turns off displaying the header periodically.

=item B<-v>

Displays version information.

=item B<delay>

B<delay> is the delay between updates in seconds, which defaults to 1.
A decimal number can be specified for intervals shorter than a second. (minimum 0.1)

=item B<count>

B<count> is the number of updates before stopping. If not specified, it is unlimited.

=back
