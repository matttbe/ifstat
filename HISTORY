=============================================== 

Releases History:

* v1.0 - 21/04/2003 "The Easter Release"
  - SIOCGIFDATA ioctl(2) support for IRIX and OpenBSD.
    (allows stats for non root users on OpenBSD).
  - Improved kvm(3) support.
  - Route sysctl support for BSD based systems.
    (allows stats for non root users on NetBSD/MacOS X).
  - Handle OpenBSD pflog interfaces as loopbacks.
    (suggested by Nick Nauwelaerts <nick@wanadoo.be>)
  - Can report total bandwith on monitored interfaces.
    (suggested by Nick Nauwelaerts <nick@wanadoo.be>)
  - Dynamic column width to cope with long interfaces names
    (can be disabled).
  - Can report bandwith in kbits/sec instead of kbytes/sec.
  - Fix handling of bandwith larger than display width.
  - Adjust to height of term when resized.
  - Can wrap long stats lines when polling lots of interfaces.
  - Can disable scrolling for one line updated display.
    (inspired from patch by Joe Laffey <software@laffeycomputer.com>)
  - Reprint headers on SIGCONT for use with shell job control.
    (suggested by Joe Laffey <software@laffeycomputer.com>)
  - Index based polling for ifmib and snmp.
  - Max number of requests per snmp packet can be set and is
    automatically lowered on "too big" errors.
    Poll interfaces independently on error.
    Walk indexes to discover available interfaces.
  - Generated interface names for snmp are really their index.
    (when using #host).
  - Ignore interfaces for which statistics are not available.
  - Can ignore "null" interfaces (0 bytes ever sent/received)
  - Can build as a static library for use in other software.
  - Can disable warnings.
  - Misc cleanups and improvements.
